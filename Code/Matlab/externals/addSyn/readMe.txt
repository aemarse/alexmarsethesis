This program (addSyn.m, envelopeGenerator.m indexFinder.m, makeSignal.m, readData.m, 
sortData.m, trumpetData.txt) implements a simple additive synthesis sound generator.  
One can write a file with parameters to control frequency envelope and amplitude 
envelope.  Some other minor additions such as time stretching and frequency shifting 
have been included.

playPiece.m just plays a little example that I did using addSyn and some generic 
sound editor.  

The "main" script is adSyn.m.
Type "help adSyn" for instructions.
